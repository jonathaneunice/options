  version: 1.4.10
  date: March 23, 2019
  notes: >
    Last notable Python 2-compatible release. Any further
    Python 2-compatible hotfixes will have version 1.4.x with
    x > 10, so requirement specification ``options~=1.4.10``.

    This release also drops Python 3.3, which is past its EOL
    and no longer testable.

-
  version: 1.4.9
  date: March 14, 2019
  notes: >
    Refresh testing matrix, pushing older version testing to Travis CI
    and adding Python 3.6 and 3.7 as primary testing platforms.

    Freshened/updated requirements, esp. for chainmap.

    Updated docs, e.g. with new PyPI URL.

-
  version: 1.4.7
  date: May 15, 2017
  notes: >
    More updates to method update scheme.

-
  version: 1.4.6
  date: May 15, 2017
  notes: >
    Updated mechanism for method-specific option setting.
    Still work in progress, but code now much cleaner.

-
    version: 1.4.5
    date: January 31, 2017
    notes: >
        Retfined testing matrix, esp for coverage.

-
    version: 1.4.4
    date: January 23, 2017
    notes: >
        Updates testing. Newly qualified under 2.7.13 and 3.6,
        as well as most recent builds of pypy and pypy3.
        Drops Python 3.2 support; should still work, but no longer
        in testing matrix.

-
  version: 1.4.2
  date: September 15, 2015
  notes: >
    Updated testing with PyPy 2.6.1 (based on 2.7.10).

-
  version: 1.4.1
  date: September 14, 2015
  notes: >
    Updated testing matrix with 3.5.0 final.

-
  version: 1.4.0
  date: August 31, 2015
  notes: >
    Major reorganization of implementation. The two-level ``Options`` and
    ``OptionsChain`` strategy replaced with single-level ``Options`` based
    directly on ``ChainMap`` (or more precisely, on an attribute-accessible
    subclass of it). It's now turtles all the way down.

    Systematic enough change that by traditional versioning standards
    this would be a 2.0 release. But following Semantic Versioning,
    while the class structure changes, the effective
    API seen by using modules does not change, so 1.4.0 is enough.

    Correctness of this systematic roto-tilling confirmed by test suite.
    Testing now extended to 100% line coverage (and 99% branch coverage).
    Some edge case issues were discovered and corrected. Thank you to
    coverage testing for ferreting those out.

    No longer depends on `stuf <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stuf>`_.
    Coupled with a new supporting `chainmap
    <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chainmap>`_ polyfill, decisively returns
    compatibility for Python 2.6 in a way that doesn't depend on the release
    schedule or priorities of external modules.

-
  version: 1.3.2
  date: Aug 26, 2015
  notes: >
    Reorganized documentation structure.

-
  version: 1.3.0
  date: Aug 25, 2015
  notes: >
    Added test branch metrics to coverage evaluation. Line coverage now 93%;
    branch coverage 92%.

    Integrated reading/writing of options data to JSON files now operational and tested.

-
  version: 1.2.5
  date: Aug 17, 2015
  notes: Inaugurated automated test coverage analysis. Extended a few tests and cleaned
    up some code as a result. Published with coverage at 88%.

-
  version: 1.2.2
  date: Aug 11, 2015
  notes: Simplified setup.

-
  version: 1.2.1
  date: Aug 4, 2015
  notes: >
    Added wheel distribution format. Updated test matrix.

    Moved from BSD to Apache Software License.

    Moved status to production/stable from beta.

-
  version: 1.2.0
  date: July 22, 2015
  notes: >
    Doc and config tweaks.

    Python 2.6 support wavering, primarily because of failure of ``stuf`` 0.9.16 to
    build there. 0.9.14 works fine. But either ``stuf`` support will have to improve
    (I've submitted a pull request that fixes the problem), or we'll have to swap
    ``stuf`` out, or we''ll have to decomit py26.

-
  version: 1.1.7
  date: December 16, 2014
  notes: Added snazzy badges to PyPI readme

-
  version: 1.1.5
  date: December 16, 2014
  notes: Changed dependencies to utilize new ``nulltype`` package (unbundling it).
    Ensured tested on all lastest Python versions.

-
  version: 1.1.1
  date: October 29, 2013
  notes: Added ``OptionsClass`` base class. If client classes inherit from this, they
    automatically get ` set()`` and ``settings()`` methods.

-
  version: 1.0.7
  date: October 25, 2103
  notes: Mainly doc tweaks.

-
  version: 1.0.4
  date: October 24, 2013
  notes: >
    When bad option names are defined ("bad" here meaning "conflicts with names
    already chosen for pre-existing methods"), a ``BadOptionName`` exception will
    be raised.

    Tweaked docs, adding comparison chart.

-
  version: 1.0.3
  date: September 23, 2013
  notes: Switched to local version of ``chainstuf`` until bug with generator values
    in ``stuf.chainstuf`` can be tracked down and corrected. This was blocking a downstream
    feature-release of ``say``.

-
  version: 1.0.2
  date: September 19, 2013
  notes: >
    Improved ``setdefault`` and ``update`` methods, and added tests, primarily
    in effort to work around bug that appears in ``stuf``, ``orderedstuf``, or ``chainstuf``
    when a mapping value is a generator.

    Documentation improved.

-
  version: 1.0.1
  date: September 14, 2013
  notes: Moved main documentation to Sphinx format in ./docs, and hosted the long-form
    documentation on readthedocs.org. README.rst now an abridged version/teaser for
    the module.

-
  version: 1.0.0
  date: September 10, 2013
  notes: >
    Cleaned up source for better PEP8 conformance

    Bumped version number to 1.0 as part of move to `semantic versioning <http://semver.org>`_,
    or at least enough of it so as to not screw up Python installation procedures
    (which don't seem to understand 0.401 is a lesser version that 0.5, because 401
    > 5).
